To set up docker registry, log into the host where the docker registry is to be set up. The registry image has to be pulled from the docker hub.
docker pull registry:2
To start the registry type the command
docker run -d --name registry -e SEARCH_BACKEND=SQLAlchemy -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true -p 5000:5000 registry:2

The first step is to build the images.
The next step is to tag the images.
Then the images are pushed to the registry

To view the images pushed to the registry, navigate to http://161.85.111.173:5000/v2/_catalog 

In order for docker-compose to pull the images from the registry, the /lib/system/system/docker.service has to be modified.
Comment the existing ExecStart and add a new ExecStart

#ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --insecure-registry=registry.net:5000

Add the ip address of registry.net in /etc/hosts
